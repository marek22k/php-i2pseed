Requirements
============

* A server is required that supports PHP (e.g. Apache)
* Cron jobs can be executed
* The I2P router runs on the same server under 127.0.0.1 without password protection
* Java
* Linux

Installation
============

1. Paste the contents of the repository into a www-root directory and put public/ online
2. Create yourself keys [see Generate keys]
3. Open cronjob.php and add the address to your i2p.jar for the variable $i2pjar and the email address you used for the key generation for $signerid.
4. Set up a cronjob so that the cronjob.php script runs regularly.
   The more often it is executed, the more up-to-date the reseed data is.

Generate keys
=============

1. Enter a private password in the private/private-2s.pw file. This can e.g. be a series of random characters.
Go to the directory with the console and execute the following command:
    java -cp [i2p.jar] net.i2p.crypto.SU3File keygen -t RSA_SHA512_4096 [name of public key file] private-2s.ks [email, can be a fake] < private-2s.pw
Replace [i2p.jar] with the path to your i2p.jar file (this can be /usr/share/i2p/lib/i2p.jar, for example).
Replace [name of public key file] with the file that stores your public key.
You should distribute this later so that your reseed server can be used.
Replace [email, can be a fake] with an email address. It doesn't have to be real. This is your so-called "Signer ID".
2. Copy your public key to the public folder:
    cp ./[name of public key file] ../public/mycert.crt
